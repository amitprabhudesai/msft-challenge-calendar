About the Author
================

Amit has been at InMobi building out advertising products 
with an emphasis on mobile video for just under three years now. 
His role involves working with multiple teams in product and engineering 
to spec out and design a solution, and work with a small, focused team 
of engineers to ship it - all within a matter of weeks. He takes pride in 
building products that are robust (hey, the InMobi SDK for Android has 
99.99+ % crash-free sessions!), performant, and deliver on key business 
metrics; and that leverage a scalable, maintainable platform that 
enables rapid innovation. 
            
Apart from his day job, he blogs at [Medium](https://medium.com/@amitprabhudesai) 
on topics on software engineering, life lessons that he learned (some the hard way) 
and sometimes just random stuff. He tweets 
[@amitprabhudesai](https://twitter.com/amitprabhudesai) on stuff that he cares and is 
passionate about. In whatever spare time he can muster while being a father to a 
spirited toddler, he likes to read, swim, cook, work out in the gym and is also 
somewhat of a [photography](https://www.instagram.com/amitprabhudesai/) buff.
